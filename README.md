# HDM-Trial1

First attempt at constructing a sandwich maker, productions would have been general enough to accomodate any task, depending on which facts the memory has. difficulties following variable from agent to motor module -> possibly could be fixed by using a buffer() to pass info between module and agent, not variable -> but I have abandoned this project for now. Both rulecomp and model file here.
